To begin this assignment I created a folder in vscode to put my homework for this class in. I then used *git clone* and a link of the assignment that I got from github in the terminal to access the assigment. I knew beforehand how to do most of the requirements for the assignemnt but had no previous experience adding images or links so I looked at *stack overflow* to find a solution for the best approach. I did have to use an online convertor for my image because it was a HEIC not a PNG but otherwise the process was quite straight forward. I then saved the md file and used *git add .* (after making sure I as in the right directory) then *git commit -m "Jayda HW1"* and *git push* in the terminal to upload it.
